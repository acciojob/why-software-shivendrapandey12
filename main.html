    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
      I want to become a software developer because I love solving problems and turning ideas into working products. Writing code lets me build tools that save time, connect people, and open new possibilities. I enjoy the mix of logical thinking and creativity — designing elegant solutions, learning new technologies, and improving through iteration. Collaboration with others and seeing the real-world impact of software motivates me to keep learning and to build things that matter.
